    <h1>The Chapter of Dr. King</h1>
    <p>“He Dreamed Through the Fire.”</p>
    <p>He saw the mountain, but knew he might not reach it. He stood before emperors and knelt beside janitors. They jailed him. They threatened his family. They murdered him.</p>
    <p>And still, the Dream walks on. Every time the weary stand tall, the Dream breathes again.</p>
