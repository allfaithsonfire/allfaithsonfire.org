<h2>Psalm of the Stranger With Cash</h2>
<p>He saw a man, just freed from jail, walking with no shoes of his own. No wallet. No plan. Just the road ahead and hope on foot.</p>
<p>Without a word, the stranger gave what he could. A few dollars. A spark of dignity. A piece of grace in a graceless place.</p>
<p>And then he was gone. A flicker of good. A stranger. A saint.</p>
