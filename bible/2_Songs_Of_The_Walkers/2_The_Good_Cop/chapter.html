<h2>Psalm of the Good Cop</h2>
<p>He could have cuffed him. Could have judged him. Could have followed orders and done the paperwork.</p>
<p>But he listened. And he drove himâ€”not to jail, but to a church. One filled with warmth, and food, and rest. One that asked nothing but that he be human again.</p>
<p>This was the law of kindness. This was the badge of light.</p>
