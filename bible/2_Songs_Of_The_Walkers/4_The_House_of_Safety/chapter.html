<h2>Psalm of the House of Safety</h2>
<p>He opened his doors to the broken. To the drugged. To the bruised. To the unloved.</p>
<p>He asked no price. No penance. Only that within his walls, they be safe. That they know they were loved.</p>
<p>This was not weakness. This was not naivety. This was sacred. And it was mighty.</p>
