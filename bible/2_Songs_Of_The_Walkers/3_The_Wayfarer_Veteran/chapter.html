<h2>Psalm of the Wayfarer Veteran</h2>
<p>He didnâ€™t have to. He was going the other way. But he drove 70 miles out of it just to carry a stranger home.</p>
<p>They talked. They laughed. They remembered what it meant to be brothers without blood.</p>
<p>He is remembered now in these verses. Not for uniform. Not for war. But for love, and the lift he gave another lost soul.</p>
