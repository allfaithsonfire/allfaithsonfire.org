<h2>The Pyramid Reclaimed</h2>
<p>Pyramids were never meant to be schemes.</p>
<p>They were meant to show us how to build—not just with stone—but with love, labor, and the divine order of service.</p>
<p>At the top: those so pure in intent, so selfless in action, that they need nothing for themselves. They are the angels—not gods, not overlords—but servants of all. They are fed not by riches, but by the love of those below.</p>
<p>Beneath them, the strong. The workers. The redeemed. Those who once suffered, but chose to serve. They were lifted up by others, and now they give more than they take. They have less need, and so they give more freely.</p>
<p>Beneath them still—the foundation. The sick. The young. The learning. The burdened. Those who suffer in silence or in screaming. Those who serve thanklessly. Those whose labor is so exhausting, so consuming, that they cannot be asked to give more.</p>
<p>These include the warriors—those willing to die for others. Not all are saints. But many serve not for pay, not for praise—but because it is right.</p>
<p>This is not a hierarchy of power. It is a cascade of grace. The higher you are, the less you need. The more you give. The more your purpose is to lift others, not rule them.</p>
<p>This is the true pyramid. A monument not to ego, but to equity. And when this structure is honored, all are sustained. No one is forgotten. No one is discarded.</p>
<p>We must reclaim this shape—not as a scam, but as a sacred geometry of kindness.</p>
<p>This is the way.</p>
