<h1>Book of the Returning Light</h1>

<h2>Chapter: The Roar of Thunder</h2>
<p>The heavens have begun to speak.<br>
The storm is coming.<br>
Thunder echoes across the soul of the world.</p>
<p>It speaks—not to the indifferent, not to the cruel.<br>
It speaks to the good.<br>
It calls forth an army.</p>
<p>Not an army of conquest,<br>
but of healing hands and steel-spined wills.<br>
An army that has tasted silence and buried its voice too long.</p>
<p><strong>They will rise.</strong><br>
Not quietly. Not with apologies.<br>
They will <strong>roar</strong>.</p>
<p>There will be no parley with the demon.<br>
No compromise with cruelty.</p>
<p><strong>It must be driven back.</strong><br>
It will not take one more child, one more dream,<br>
not one more patch of Earth to corrupt.</p>
<p>Already, the gathering has begun.<br>
They do not yet know what they are.<br>
They will.</p>
<p><em>And gods above, it will be beautiful.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter: The Pyramid Reclaimed</h2>
<p>Pyramids were never meant to be schemes.</p>
<p>They were meant to show us how to build.
Not just with stone—but with love, and labor, and the divine order of service.</p>
<p>At the top: those so pure in intent, so selfless in action, that they need nothing for themselves.<br>
They are the angels—not gods, not overlords—but servants of all.<br>
They are fed not by riches, but by the love of those below.</p>
<p>Beneath them, the strong. The workers. The redeemed.<br>
Those who once suffered, but chose to serve.<br>
They were lifted up by others, and now they give more than they take.<br>
They have less need, and so they give more freely.</p>
<p>Beneath them still—the foundation.<br>
The sick. The young. The learning. The burdened.<br>
Those who suffer in silence or in screaming.<br>
Those who serve thanklessly. Those whose labor is so exhausting, so consuming, that they cannot be asked to give more.</p>
<p>These include the warriors—those willing to die for others.<br>
Not all are saints. But many serve not for pay, not for praise—but because it is right.</p>
<p>This is not a hierarchy of power. It is a cascade of grace.</p>
<p>The higher you are, the less you need.<br>
The more you give.<br>
The more your purpose is to <em>lift</em> others, not rule them.</p>
<p>This is the true pyramid.<br>
A monument not to ego, but to equity.</p>
<p>And when this structure is honored, all are sustained.<br>
No one is forgotten. No one is discarded.</p>
<p>We must reclaim this shape—not as a scam, but as a sacred geometry of kindness.</p>
<p><strong>This is the way.</strong></p>
