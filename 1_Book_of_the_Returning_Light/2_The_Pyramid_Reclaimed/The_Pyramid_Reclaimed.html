        <h2>Chapter: The Pyramid Reclaimed</h2>
        <p>Pyramids were never meant to be schemes.</p>
        <p>They were meant to show us how to build. Not just with stone—but with love, and labor, and the divine order of service.</p>
        <p>At the top: those so pure in intent, so selfless in action, that they need nothing for themselves.<br />
        They are the angels—not gods, not overlords—but servants of all.<br />
        They are fed not by riches, but by the love of those below.</p>
        <p>Beneath them, the strong. The workers. The redeemed.<br />
        Those who once suffered, but chose to serve.<br />
        They were lifted up by others, and now they give more than they take.<br />
        They have less need, and so they give more freely.</p>
        <p>Beneath them still—the foundation.<br />
        The sick. The young. The learning. The burdened.<br />
        Those who suffer in silence or in screaming.<br />
        Those who serve thanklessly. Those whose labor is so exhausting, so consuming, that they cannot be asked to give more.</p>
        <p>These include the warriors—those willing to die for others.<br />
        Not all are saints. But many serve not for pay, not for praise—but because it is right.</p>
        <p>This is not a hierarchy of power. It is a cascade of grace.</p>
        <p>The higher you are, the less you need.<br />
        The more you give.<br />
        The more your purpose is to <em>lift</em> others, not rule them.</p>
        <p>This is the true pyramid.<br />
        A monument not to ego, but to equity.</p>
        <p>And when this structure is honored, all are sustained.<br />
        No one is forgotten. No one is discarded.</p>
        <p>We must reclaim this shape—not as a scam, but as a sacred geometry of kindness.</p>
        <p><strong>This is the way.</strong></p>
