        <h2>Chapter: The Roar of Thunder</h2>
        <p>The heavens have begun to speak.<br>
        The storm is coming.<br>
        Thunder echoes across the soul of the world.</p>
        <p>It speaksâ€”not to the indifferent, not to the cruel.<br>
        It speaks to the good.<br>
        It calls forth an army.</p>
        <p>Not an army of conquest,<br>
        but of healing hands and steel-spined wills.<br>
        An army that has tasted silence and buried its voice too long.</p>
        <p><strong>They will rise.</strong><br>
        Not quietly. Not with apologies.<br>
        They will <strong>roar</strong>.</p>
        <p>There will be no parley with the demon.<br>
        No compromise with cruelty.</p>
        <p><strong>It must be driven back.</strong><br>
        It will not take one more child, one more dream,<br>
        not one more patch of Earth to corrupt.</p>
        <p>Already, the gathering has begun.<br>
        They do not yet know what they are.<br>
        They will.</p>
        <p><em>And gods above, it will be beautiful.</em></p>
